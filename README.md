>ðŸ¤– ðŸ•¶ Innovation Edge's Cisco Spark bot that fetches pokemon, projects, news, answers questions, and more! Edit

Cisco Spark is powerful communication tool for empowering collaboration among teams within a global space or business. To illustrate the power of chatbots, we've created our own personal assitant, the `innovation-edge-bot`! It also has natural language understanding so you can freely ask it many things, here are some sample phrases:

- "I want to learn more about innovation edge"
- "Tell me more about you guys"
- "What are you guys working on?"
- "Show me your projects."
- "Simon Says, `<statement>`"
- "How long have you been up?"
- "Do you know any pokemon?"
- "Show me news for `<news topic>`"
- "What's happening in `<news topic>`?"

To use our bot, message **innovation-edge@sparkbot.io** on [Cisco Spark](https://www.ciscospark.com/)
